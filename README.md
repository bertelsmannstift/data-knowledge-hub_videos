# Data Knowledge Hub for Researching Online Discourse - Video Repository

The **Data Knowledge Hub**[https://github.com/bertelsmannstift/data-knowledge-hub] is an initiative designed to serve as a central resource for those interested in monitoring social media and online discourse. It is aimed at researchers, social scientists, data scientists, journalists, practitioners, and policymakers.

Part of our hub are videos in which our experts provide explanations and step-by-step instructions. With the intention of reducing the file size of the Data Knowledge Hub repository, all videos are stored here.
